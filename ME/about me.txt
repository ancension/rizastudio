I'm a Digital Artist with freelance experience since 2021. My journey began with traditional art at 13, later growing into digital illustration using just my phone. Over the years, my creative interests have expanded into graphic design, animation, video editing, and short film production.
I hold a 3-year Diploma in Digital Arts Technology, where I refined my skills in 2D/3D animation, video editing, and graphic design. I'm passionate about exploring new tools and techniques, always eager to learn and grow through every creative challenge. This mindset fuels the variety found in my work‚Äîfrom commissioned pieces to personal and academic projects.
Beyond digital art, I enjoy songwriting, composing, crocheting, and filmmaking. I'm always open to commissions and collaborations that bring ideas to life through visual storytelling.
